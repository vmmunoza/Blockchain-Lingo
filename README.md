# Blockchain-Lingo
Basic Lingo in Blockchain

Node: A computer connected to a blockchain network that stores a copy of the blockchain and helps validate transactions.

Ledger: A digital record of all transactions that have occurred on the blockchain.

Transaction: A transfer of value or data that is recorded on the blockchain.

Block: A collection of transactions bundled together and added to the blockchain.

Hash: A cryptographic code that uniquely identifies data in a block, ensuring data integrity.

Mining: The process of validating and adding transactions to the blockchain, often involving solving complex cryptographic puzzles (used in Proof of Work systems).

Consensus Mechanism: A method used by blockchain networks to agree on the validity of transactions (e.g., Proof of Work, Proof of Stake).

Smart Contract: Self-executing contracts with the terms directly written into code, running on a blockchain.

dApp (Decentralized Application): An application that runs on a blockchain network rather than a centralized server.

Token: A digital asset issued on a blockchain, which can represent value, utility, or a stake in a project.

Cryptocurrency: A digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security, operating on a blockchain (e.g., Bitcoin, Ether).

Wallet: A software application or hardware device used to store and manage cryptocurrency and blockchain assets.

Private Key: A cryptographic key that allows the owner to access and manage their blockchain assets; must be kept secret.

Public Key: A cryptographic key that is shared publicly and allows others to verify transactions and send assets to the corresponding wallet.

DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization): An organization governed by smart contracts, with decisions made by token holders' votes.

Layer 2 (L2): Solutions built on top of a primary blockchain (Layer 1) to improve scalability and efficiency (e.g., Metis on Ethereum).

Fork: A split in the blockchain into two separate chains, often due to changes in the protocol or disagreements among participants.

Gas: A unit of measure for computational work on a blockchain, often used to pay for transaction fees (e.g., in Ethereum).
